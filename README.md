# TypeScript-Star-Wars-Quiz

TypeScript, JavaScript based Star Wars Quiz website is a website.

When I developed this project, it was not to create a big project, but to use my knowledge while learning TypeScript to create a product.
In this way, rather than a complex project, I both reinforced my JavaScript knowledge and put the theoretical knowledge I gained in TypeScript into practice.

There is not a very elaborate structure in my project. First of all, the user is logged in to the quiz on the home page page that appears to the user. 
Then he answers the correct one of the 5 questions that appear in front of him. Finally, the number of correct answers in 5 questions appears in front of the user.
